# Overview
This is a basic Task Manager project using Kotlin through IntelliJ IDEA. This is my first time working with Kotlin. 
The user is given a menu screen where they can either add a task to the task list, delete a task, check of a task, view the current task list, or exit the system. 
My purpose in creating this program was to learn some Kotlin fundamentals and create the basis for a future app.
